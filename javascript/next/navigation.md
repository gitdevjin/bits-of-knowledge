# 🧭 Two main types of navigation in web apps:
## 1. Client-side navigation ✅
Handled entirely in the browser without a full page reload

Used by frameworks like: Next.js, React Router, Vue Router

### 🔍 What happens:
- JavaScript intercepts the link or router action

- It updates the URL using history.pushState

- It dynamically loads the new page’s content (via code splitting or dynamic import)

- No page reload, no white flash

### 🟢 Benefits:
- Very fast — only fetches what’s needed

- Smooth transitions

- Can preserve React state (e.g., scroll position or form inputs)

- Feels like a single-page app (SPA)

### ✨ In Next.js:
- `<Link href="/about" />`

- `router.push('/about')`

These trigger client-side navigation.

## 2. Server-side navigation (traditional)
Browser sends a full request to the server → gets back a new HTML page

Used by: traditional websites (e.g., PHP, Rails, plain HTML)

### 🔍 What happens:
- Browser makes an HTTP request (GET /about)

- Server sends a whole new HTML page

- Browser reloads, parses, and re-renders the page

### 🔴 Downsides:
- Slower (reloads everything)

- Browser state (scroll, form input) is lost

- More data is re-fetched than necessary

## 🧠 Summary Table
| Feature |	Client-side Navigation |	Server-side Navigation |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| Full page reload?	| ❌ No	 | ✅ Yes |
| Speed	| ⚡ Fast |	🐢 Slower |
| React state kept? |	✅ Yes	| ❌ No |
| How triggered? |	`<Link>`, `router.push()` |	`<a href="...">` |
| UX feel	| Like a single-page app (SPA) |	Like a full website reload |

### 🧪 How to test
If you're in a Next.js app:

- Clicking a `<Link>` or running `router.push()` won't reload the page (no flicker)

- If you right-click → "Open in new tab" → that’s a server-side request

# Q. if I use react app, which doesn't have server, then how could it do server-side navigation with `<a>` tag?

### 🔍 If you're using a plain React app (like from `create-react-app`) and you use an `<a href="/about">` tag:
### 👉 It will trigger a full page reload (server-side navigation)
—even if your app is running on a dev server like `localhost:3000`.

Because:

A plain `<a>` tag is handled by the browser

The browser thinks: “Ah! You want to go to `/about`”

So it sends a new HTTP request to `localhost:3000/about`

This clears the current page and loads everything again

## 🛑 But React apps aren’t meant to reload pages!
If you use create-react-app, it assumes you're building a Single Page App (SPA), where routing is done entirely in the browser (client-side).

### So what happens on a real server?
If your server isn't configured to handle unknown paths (like `/about`), you might even get a 404 error!

### ✅ How do SPAs like React avoid this?
They use a client-side router, such as:

`react-router-dom`

Which provides:

```javascript
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

<Link to="/about">About</Link>
```
Or programmatically:

```javascript
const navigate = useNavigate();
navigate("/about");
```

These:
- Prevent the default `<a>` behavior

- Use `history.pushState` under the hood

- Update the URL and render the new component without reload

## 🧠 TL;DR
| Action	| Navigation Type	| Result |
|-------|----------|------|
| `<a href="/about">` in React | 	❌ Server-side navigation	| Full reload, bad for SPAs |
| `<Link to="/about" />` |	✅ Client-side navigation	| Smooth transition, no reload |
| `useNavigate()` | 	✅ Client-side navigation	| Programmatic, still no reload |

### ✅ Final Tip
If you're building a React SPA, always use `react-router-dom` (or similar) for navigation — not raw `<a>` tags — unless you're linking to external URLs.
