The terms URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) and URL (Uniform Resource Locator) are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the differences between them:

URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
Definition: A URI is a string of characters that uniquely identifies a resource. It can refer to either a location or an identifier of the resource.
Structure: A URI can be further categorized into two types:
URL (Uniform Resource Locator): Specifies the location of a resource on the internet and how to retrieve it. It includes the protocol (e.g., HTTP, FTP), domain name, and path.
URN (Uniform Resource Name): Identifies a resource by name in a particular namespace but does not provide location information (e.g., urn:isbn:0451450523 for a book).
Examples:
http://example.com/path/to/resource (this is also a URL)
urn:isbn:0451450523 (this is a URN)
URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
Definition: A URL is a specific type of URI that not only identifies a resource but also provides a means to locate it by describing its primary access mechanism (e.g., its network location).
Components: A URL typically includes:
Protocol: The method used to access the resource (e.g., http, https, ftp).
Host: The domain name or IP address where the resource is hosted (e.g., example.com).
Path: The specific location of the resource on the server (e.g., /path/to/resource).
Query parameters: Optional parameters for the request (e.g., ?key=value).
Examples:
https://www.example.com/index.html
ftp://ftp.example.com/resource.txt
Summary
All URLs are URIs: Every URL is a URI, but not every URI is a URL. A URL provides the means to locate a resource, while a URI can serve as a broader identifier that may not specify how to access the resource.
Contextual Usage: In most web-related discussions, people use "URL" when referring to web addresses, while "URI" may be used in more technical contexts to refer to either a URL or a URN.
Conclusion
In essence, you can think of a URI as a more general concept for identifying resources, while a URL is a specific way to access a resource through the web.
