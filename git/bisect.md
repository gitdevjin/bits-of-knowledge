git bisect is a powerful Git command that helps you find the commit that introduced a bug or issue by performing a binary search through your commit history. It's particularly useful when you know that a problem was introduced at some point in the past, but you're unsure which commit caused it.

How It Works
git bisect works by repeatedly checking out commits in the history of your Git repository and testing whether the issue is present or not. You provide it with a "good" commit (a commit where the bug is not present) and a "bad" commit (where the bug is present). Git will then automatically check out commits in between, allowing you to test each commit in a binary search manner.

Steps to Use git bisect
Start Bisecting:
First, tell Git where to start by specifying the "bad" (current commit with the issue) and the "good" commit (a commit where the issue did not exist).

bash
Copy code
git bisect start
git bisect bad  # this is the current commit with the bug
git bisect good <commit-hash>  # replace <commit-hash> with a commit where the bug didn't occur
Testing the Commit:
After running the above, Git will check out a commit in the middle of the "good" and "bad" range. You now need to test if the bug is present or not in this commit.

If the bug is present in the checked-out commit, mark it as bad:
bash
Copy code
git bisect bad
If the bug is not present, mark it as good:
bash
Copy code
git bisect good
Repeat:
Git will continue narrowing down the commit range by halving the range each time, checking out the middle commit for you to test. You'll continue to mark the commits as either "good" or "bad" based on your testing.

Finish Bisecting:
Once Git has narrowed down the commits and finds the exact commit that introduced the bug, it will tell you which commit is the culprit. You can then reset your repository back to the branch or commit you were working on:

bash
Copy code
git bisect reset
Example Workflow
Imagine you have a repository with a bug, and you know it was introduced between two commits. Here's how you might use git bisect to find the culprit commit.

Start bisecting:

```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad  # current commit with the bug
git bisect good <commit-hash>  # last known good commit
```
Git checks out a commit in the middle:

If the bug is present, mark it as bad:
```bash
git bisect bad
```
If the bug is not present, mark it as good:
bash
Copy code
git bisect good
Git narrows the search and keeps checking out the middle commits. After several steps, youâ€™ll reach the commit that introduced the bug.

Reset the bisect:

bash
Copy code
git bisect reset
Why Use git bisect?
Efficient Bug Detection: Instead of manually checking each commit, git bisect uses binary search to quickly narrow down the problematic commit.
Automatable: You can automate the process of testing commits by using a script with git bisect run.
Precise: It helps you precisely locate the commit where a bug was introduced, saving time and effort in debugging.
Advanced Usage - Bisecting Automatically with a Script
If you have a way to test whether the bug is present (for example, a script that can run tests), you can automate the bisecting process. For example:

bash
```
git bisect start
git bisect bad
git bisect good <commit-hash>
git bisect run ./test_script.sh
```
Here, test_script.sh should return a success code (0) if the bug is not present and a failure code (1) if the bug is present. This way, git bisect will automatically perform the binary search, running the script to check each commit.

Summary
git bisect is a tool for identifying the commit that introduced a bug by performing a binary search across your commit history. By marking good and bad commits, it narrows down the range of commits and finds the exact commit that caused the problem. It can be used interactively or automated with a script for more efficiency.
