The `parseInt` function is used here to ensure that the value of `process.env.PORT` (or the default value `8080` if `process.env.PORT` is not set) is treated as an integer. This is important because:

1. **Environment Variables Are Strings**:

    - The `process.env.PORT` value comes from environment variables, which are always stored as strings. Even if you set `PORT=8080` in your environment, it is treated as `'8080'`.

2. **Ensuring Numeric Type for Port**:

     - Many parts of the Node.js ecosystem, such as `app.listen(port, ...)`, expect the `port` argument to be a number, not a string. If you pass a string, it may cause unexpected behavior or errors.

3. **Base-10 Parsing**:

    - The second argument to `parseInt`, `10`, specifies the base for the numeric conversion. It ensures the string is interpreted as a decimal number. Without explicitly specifying the base, some strings (e.g., `'08'`) might be misinterpreted in environments where the default base is not 10.


```javascript
const port = parseInt(process.env.PORT || '8080', 10);
console.log(typeof port); // 'number'
```
If `parseInt` were not used, `port` would be a string:

```javascript
const port = process.env.PORT || '8080';
console.log(typeof port); // 'string'
```

#### Why It's Important
- Using `parseInt` avoids potential type mismatch issues.
- It guarantees the port value is a valid integer before being passed to the server.

#### Alternative in Modern JavaScript
If you're confident about the input format and want an alternative, you could use the unary `+` operator:

```javascript
const port = +(process.env.PORT || '8080');
```
However, parseInt is more explicit and widely understood.
