The difference between `npm run <command>` and `npm <command>` depends on whether the command is a predefined npm command or a custom script defined in the scripts section of your package.json file.

### 1. `npm <command>` (Predefined Commands):

These are commands that are built into npm, and you can use them without needing to define them yourself in the scripts section.

Examples:

- `npm install` (or just `npm i`): Installs the dependencies listed in your `package.json`.
- `npm init`: Initializes a new Node.js project by creating a `package.json` file.
- `npm test`: Runs the test scripts defined in your `package.json`. (Note: The default behavior is to run npm run test, which can be overridden by defining a test script.)
- `npm update`: Updates the installed packages.
- `npm run <command>`: This is used to run a custom script defined in the scripts section.

### 2. `npm run <command>` (Custom Scripts):
When you define custom scripts in the `"scripts"` section of your `package.json` file, you run them using `npm run <command>`.

For example, if you have a script defined like this:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node src/index.js",
  "dev": "nodemon src/index.js"
}
```

- To start the server: `npm start` (npm automatically knows about the `start` script, so you can use `npm start` directly).
To run a custom development server: `npm run dev`

So, when to use `npm run <command>`:

Use `npm run <command>` for any custom script that you've defined in the scripts section of your `package.json`. This includes commands like `npm run start`, `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, etc.

When you don’t need run:
For npm built-in commands (e.g., `npm install`, `npm test`, `npm init`), you don’t need to use run—just type the command directly like `npm install` or `npm test`.


### Summary:
- `npm run <command>`: Use this to run custom scripts defined in your `package.json`.
- `npm <command>`: Use this for built-in npm commands like `npm install`, `npm test`, etc.


### Exception
Actually, `npm start` is a special case. Even though it is a custom script defined in your package.json, you don't need to use `npm run` for start.

`npm start` is a default command built into npm. When you define a `"start"` script in your `package.json`, npm automatically recognizes `npm start` as a shorthand for running the `"start"` script.
