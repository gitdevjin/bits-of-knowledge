### Q. When `cookieParser()` is called, `the app.use()` will get the returned fucntion and add into a list of middleware?

Yes, that's correct! When `app.use(cookieParser())` is called, here's what happens:

`cookieParser()`:

`cookieParser()` is a function that returns another function (a middleware function).
The returned middleware function is responsible for parsing the Cookie header and attaching the parsed cookies to `req`.cookies and `req.signedCookies` in the incoming request.

`app.use()`:

`app.use()` is an Express function that adds middleware to a stack (list) of middleware functions.
When you call `app.use(cookieParser())`, you're adding the middleware function returned by `cookieParser()` to this stack.
Request handling:

When an HTTP request is received, Express will go through the list of middleware functions, including the one returned by `cookieParser()`, in the order they were added.
The `cookieParser()` middleware will run, parse the cookies from the request, and store them in `req.cookies` and `req.signedCookies.`
After it's done, it calls `next()` to move on to the next middleware in the stack.
So, `cookieParser()` generates a middleware function that `app.use()` adds to the middleware stack, which is then invoked during the request-response cycle.
