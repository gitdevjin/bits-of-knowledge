Let me clarify the difference between pino-pretty and pino-http:

### pino-pretty:
`Purpose`: It's a log formatting tool that makes Pino logs human-readable and aesthetically better in the terminal.

`Usage`: It takes the structured JSON logs produced by Pino and formats them into a more readable format with colors and other visual enhancements.

`When to Use`: Typically used in development or local environments where you need the logs to be more readable. It's not intended for production because it can add some performance overhead.

Example of formatted output from `pino-pretty`:

```csharp
[2025-01-01 12:34:56.789] INFO  (server.js:10) - Server started on port 8080
```

In contrast, the default output from Pino is structured JSON:
```json
{"level":30,"time":1672703496789,"msg":"Server started on port 8080","pid":1234}
```

### pino-http:
`Purpose`: It's an HTTP request logging middleware for Pino. It automatically logs HTTP request details (like method, URL, status code, response time, etc.) for every incoming request.

`Usage`: It adds automatic logging of HTTP requests and responses in an Express (or other HTTP server) app.
`When to Use`: Used in production or live environments to capture essential request data for monitoring or debugging purposes.

Example of logs from pino-http:
```less
[2025-01-01 12:35:01.234] INFO  (server.js:20) - GET /home 200 2ms
```

### Key Differences:
`pino-pretty`: Focuses on formatting the log output to make it more readable (aesthetic improvements, color coding, etc.).

It doesn’t log HTTP requests specifically.
It’s used for better visualization of logs in the console.

`pino-http`: Focuses on logging HTTP request information (method, URL, status, etc.).

It adds an HTTP request logging mechanism to your server, so every HTTP request gets logged automatically.
It’s used for automating HTTP request logs.

#### In Summary:
`pino-pretty` improves the appearance of logs in development.
`pino-http` logs HTTP request/response information.

Both are useful in different contexts but can be used together without conflict. For example, in development, you might use both to have readable HTTP request logs with enhanced formatting.
