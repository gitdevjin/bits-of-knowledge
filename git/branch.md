You are correct! Letâ€™s clarify how git checkout branch-name behaves based on whether a local or remote branch exists:

Scenario 1: Local Branch Exists
Command: `git checkout branch-name`
Behavior: If a local branch named branch-name exists, Git will switch you to that branch. No new branch is created, and no changes to branches happen.


Scenario 2: Remote Branch Exists, No Local Branch
Command: git checkout branch-name
Behavior: If there is no local branch named branch-name, but there is a corresponding remote branch (e.g., `origin/branch-name`), Git will:
Create a new local branch named branch-name.
Set it to track the remote branch (`origin/branch-name`).
Switch you to this new local branch.

Scenario 3: if there is the same name branch on local,
and you want to make a local branch with the remote branch that has the same name
you can use the following commend
```bash
git checkout -b new-branch-name origin/branch-name
```


Scenario 4: No Branch Exists
Command: `git checkout branch-name`
Behavior: If neither a local branch named branch-name nor a corresponding remote branch exists, Git will return an error message indicating that the branch does not exist.
Summary
So, the behavior of git checkout branch-name can lead to three possible outcomes:

Switch to an existing local branch.
Create and switch to a new local branch that tracks the remote branch if it exists.
Return an error if neither exists.
If you try to check out a branch that doesn't exist locally or remotely, you'll get an error message like:

```lua
error: pathspec 'branch-name' did not match any file(s) known to git.
```
